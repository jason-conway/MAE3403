# Why
Redundancy is key, and an off-site copy of my work makes me feel safe in the case of a hardware failure. 
Also all the cool software I write is proprietary and hidden but I want to appear active on Github. 

# Caution
This repo is purely intended for version control. 

Per the syllabus, "Your homework must be entirely your own work. You may not receive files or lines of code from other students, modify them and submit them as part of your own work."
